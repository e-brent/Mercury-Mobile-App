transferring build: 

- send code or download off github
- get rid of bundle identifier, package, possibly project id in app.json
- if it comes down to it, might just delete everything eas related
- if it really really comes down to it, just copy the code over to a new expo project in a Mercury account (ask about Mercury github??)

- to publish app: 

1. create google developer account ($25 one-time fee) and apple developer account ($99 annual fee)
2. have end-user license agreement and privacy policies (terms of use also recommended)

3.
